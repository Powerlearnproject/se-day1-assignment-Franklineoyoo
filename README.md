#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. 
It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960's
   Description: Before high-level languages, programming was done in machine code or assembly language, which was cumbersome and error-prone. The development of high-level languages like FORTRAN (1957) and COBOL (1959) allowed programmers to write code more efficiently and in a way that was easier to understand and maintain.
   Impact: This milestone made software development more accessible and laid the foundation for more complex and abstract software engineering practices.
2. The advent of structured programming in the 1970's
   Description: Structured programming emerged as a response to the "software crisis," where growing software complexity led to increased errors and maintenance difficulties. Pioneers like Edsger Dijkstra promoted the use of clear control structures (such as loops and conditionals) and modular code organization.
   Impact: This approach reduced bugs, made code more readable and maintainable, and paved the way for modern software development methodologies.
3. Rise of Agile methodologies in the 2000's
   Description: Agile methodologies, including frameworks like Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP), emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility. Agile emerged as a response to the limitations of traditional, linear development models like Waterfall.
   Impact: Agile transformed software engineering by promoting adaptability, faster release cycles, and continuous customer feedback, becoming the dominant approach in the industry today.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Engineer - Helps in writing code and implementing software solutions.
2. Quality Assurance Engineer - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3. Project Manager - Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
